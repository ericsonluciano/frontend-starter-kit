# frontend-starter-kit

> Boilerplate for a frontend project powered by Metalsmith.

This is a small project that takes a bunch of HTML, CSS, JS files (`web/`) and turns them into a website (`public/`). Use it to build your new Reddit webapp, [Pokemon tool](http://weedlecalc.com/), Firebase-based webapp, [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/) app assets, or whatever suits your fancy.

<br>

## Usage

Bootstrap into a project:

```
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
wget https://github.com/rstacruz/frontend-starter-kit/archive/master.tar.gz -O - | tar zxv --strip-components=1
npm install
```

Run in development (or production):

```
npm start
```

Build:

```
npm run build
```

<br>

## Paths

| Path | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `/web/assets` | All files here are mapped onto `/public` after compilation. |
| `/web/css` | Sass files. These are Sass `@import`ed from `/web/assets/app.scss`. |
| `/web/js` | Browserify sources. These are defined from config in metalsmith.js. |
| `/public` | Where things are built into. |

<br>

## What you get

- Extensible _everything_ build pipeline (via [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io))
- Extensible JavaScript build pipeline (via [Browserify](http://browserify.org/))
- Modern JavaScript with support for ES2015, React JSX, and so on (via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/))
- Modern CSS via Sass, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer
- Support for Pug (as well as any templating language) via [jstransformer](https://github.com/RobLoach/metalsmith-jstransformer)
- Production-ready tools (JS and CSS compression)
- Super-useful development server (via [metalsmith-start](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-start))
- Ready to deploy to Heroku (just `git push`)

<br>

## What you DON'T get

It's opinionated, but only up to a point. All it does is take `web/` and turn it into `public/` with a production build command (`npm run build`) and a development auto-watcher command (`npm start`). The rest is up to you.

These things are not included here:

- React (bring your own framework!)
- Testing boilerplate (bring your own testing tools!)
- CSS framework (bring your own Bootstrap/Foundation/etc!)
- ...and so on

<br>

## Why Metalsmith?

__Metalsmith is a compiler "framework".__ Its purpose in life is to take a folder (`web/`) and turn it into another folder (`public/`).

__It's (kinda) functional.__ Metalsmith brings together plugins that transform files into new files. A Metalsmith plugin is simply a `map()` for your entire project. Your build pipeline is simply a series of `map()`s.

__It's also great for development.__ [metalsmith-start](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-start) is a fantastic development server for Metalsmith. It rebuilds your files instantaneously as you change them, supports LiveReloading, and can run on any Metalsmith project.

__It simplifies many things.__ Everything here is in <100 lines of JS and JSON (including package.json). The only significant pieces here are `metalsmith.js` and the Babel config in `package.json`.

<br>

## Why not X?

- You can use [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) (it compiles JS wonderfully!), but webpack won't copy over any non-JS files (`.html`, `.png` and so on). It also won't compile into CSS (it'll compile your CSS into JS, yuck).

- You can use [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) (it does the same folder-into-another-folder build style!), but Brunch has its own JS build pipeline, which is very hard to work with. It also doesn't support webpack/browserify.

- You can use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (it ties together build tools, too!), but interoperability between Gulp plugins is dismal. Good luck getting real-time file watching working with Browserify. Try to get LiveReload working without losing your hair and you'll see.

- You can use [Grunt](http://gulpjs.com/) (it's a task runner everyone loves! or at least used to), but I'll let [this article](https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/) explain why you shouldn't.

## Where to go from here

You can also add support for:

- [fingerprinting](https://github.com/superwolff/metalsmith-fingerprint-ignore)
- non-Pug [partials](https://github.com/RobLoach/metalsmith-jstransformer-partials)
- [PostCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-postcss)
- Other template engines via jstransformer (eg, [jstransformer-swig](https://github.com/jstransformers/jstransformer-swig)).
- Add tests with your favorite test framework
